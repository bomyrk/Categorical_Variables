This example is from the book **Approaching Almost Any Machine Learning**

We are going to work on MNIST datase, we will use the csv format that consist of 784 points for each row. Each row is an image and those 784 point represent value of pixels that vary between 0 and 255. In fact an image is 28 * 28 pixels * 1 in depth (grayscale color).

The train data consist in 60 000 images and are in the input folder.

We will build multiple models
- OneHot Encoding LogisticRegression
- xgboost
